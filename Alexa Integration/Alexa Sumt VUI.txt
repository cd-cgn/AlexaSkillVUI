Hi 

I have completed the Alexa integration Dev Plan & I am ready for the demo. As of today, these user requests can be handled & we can certainly scale it easily to include more features.

User
 - Alexa, open Sum Total.
Alexa
 - Hi, welcome to Sum Total. As of now, I have a feature to navigate to development plan. How can I help you?
 

User
 - Navigate to Development Plan.
Alexa
 - Development plan opened Successfully. I can help you with listing out all your development plan tasks & provide status of any task in your list. How can I help you?

Alexa
